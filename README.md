# Unity: ScriptableObjects Game Events System
Based on a great talk by Ryan Hipple, here is my improved version of his Game Event system for Unity


This project doesn't use any namespaces. 
Conflicts with your own code my happen if you have any classes named the same.

There is 3 classes:
GameEvent
EventLister
EventAndResponse

## Installation
Just download the files and drag them into your Asset folder (or any subfolder of your creation) in Unity.
